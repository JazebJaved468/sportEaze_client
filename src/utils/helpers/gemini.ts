If any atleast one media   then the is_sports_related should be false. Also note that if media is 20% sports related then it should be considered as sports related. also if a single media is a a screenshotot itself has multiple images so just dont be too strict with that, if it is 10% sports related then it's ok to consider it as sports related.`;

Note: - The model is trained on a variety of sports-related content, so it should be able to generalize to different sports. - The response should not be containing backticks or some thing like (\`\`\`json) ok , it should be a plain json object. - If any atleast one media or caption is not sports related then the is_sports_related should be false. Also note that iif media is 20% sports related then it should be considered as sports related. also a single media is a ascreenshot ot itself has multiple images so just dont be too strict with that, if it is 10% sports related then it's ok to consider it as sports related. `;
